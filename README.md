Java application that utilises various data structures and algorithms to effectively store, manage, and search through a large dataset of film information. The data is provided across three separate files:

Movie Metadata: Contains details like film ID, title, length, and overview.

Credits: Includes information about the cast and crew for each film.

Ratings: Holds user ratings and the date they were submitted.

This project involves implementing the required data structures and search algorithms within a pre-defined Java framework to ensure high performance and efficiency.
